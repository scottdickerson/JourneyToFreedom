        Unwise leadership and democratic chicanery have reduced the Negro politicians in the eastern and northern parts of Texas to a very few. No man knows the cause of this so well as one who lives there. That is beyond doubt one of the most corrupt parts of Texas. The whites have driven some Negroes out of politics by the midnight shotgun speeches. Others have been silenced by taking the schools into politics. Those who will not vote the democratic ticket and make democratic speeches are not allowed to teach schools. Merit amounts to nothing in that part of the state. If you are not a democrat, you lose your head under their shotgun, force bills of law passed by the bloodiest mobs, composed of some of the best citizens of the State, under the cover of midnight. The Negroes suffer from this kind of legislation. Incompetent and disgraceful tricksters are often placed at the head of their schools over their protestâ€¦.
