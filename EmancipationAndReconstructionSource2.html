        <b>Reports murders, outrages &c., committed on white men and freedmen in Washington County; Brenham Texas, Oct. 13th, 1866</b>

        Col.,
        <br/>
        The report called for by the Asst. Comr. in relation to murders and outrages committed upon Union men and Freedmen in this County since the close of the rebellion I am unable to make for the reason that there are no records in this office of murders, outrages &c.
        <br/><br/>
        I have picked up a few cases which may be of use to your. I give them to you as they were given to me and have no doubt but that all can be proven. They are as follows.
        In August 1865 a freedman named King Davis was shot and killed on Mill Creek by one Davis known as "Dock Davis." This freedman it is alleged was murdered for attempting to leave Davis and fined employment elsewhere after learning that he was free. A military force was sent by Capt. Post Comndg. at Brenham to arrest Davis, but failed to find him. He (Davis) has however returned and is now living on Mill Creek nine miles south of Brenham.
        <br/><br/>
        In the month of August or Sept. 1865 a colored boy 16 or 17 years of age was shot in the arm making amputation necessary above the elbow by Erwin Randle, son of Dr. Randle of Independence. It is alleged that this boy was shot for asking his master if he was not free and on being told by him that he was not replied that he could not believe it as all the other "darkeys" were free. Erwin Randle left the county at the time but I understand is in the County now.
        <br/><br/>
        On the 28th day of April 1866 at or near Union Hill in Washington County were murdered two freedmen and one freedwoman named respectively James Mayfield, Green Taylor, and Maria Taylor. There murders were committed after night by a party of white men eight or ten in number. The freedmen, five in number, lived alone in a house upon a Mr. Husier's farm. The two persons who were spared - an old man and woman - could not swear positively to the names of the murderers but thought they were young men of the neighborhood. Four arrests were made and two of the number tried by Military Commission and acquitted for want of positive evidence.
        <br/><br/>
        On the 9th day of Sept. 1866 Mr. Thomas Alya was assaulted in the town of Brenham by one Airey who shook a six shooter over his head and called him a d-d yank and threatened to shoot him. Mr. Alya is a native of Indiana, emigrated to this county and state prior to the rebellion, kept out of the rebel army until tried by a vigilance committee when he was furnished with a hangmans noose. This man (Alya) has always been a good Union man, but has been obliged to sell out here and leave the County on account of his Union sentiments and is now in Houston, Tex.
        <br/><br/>
        Very Respectfully
        <br/>
        Your Obedt. Servt.
