        <b>Runaway</b>
        <br/>
        FROM me three months ago, an African negro man named ARCH; he is about 25 years of age, a tall slim fellow, very black, some scars on his forehead, also some small scars on each side of his cheek, and a long foot; he has been taken up five or six times, since he ran off from me, and made his escape every time; he has broke irons off twice since he left me; he is a great rascal, and has as much sense as an American negro; he speaks but little English. I will pay any man a liberal reward who will take up said negro, have him ironed and delivered, or secured so that I get him. My brother, P.D. McNeel had an African negro man that ran off in company with Arch when he left me first; his name is IONA, about 28 years of age, scarred on the face and on each side of his cheeks, and very much cut and scarred round his neck: he is of yellow complexion, and a stout built man, speaks some English: he ran off last year, and was taken in Robertson's colony. I have no doubt he is somewhere in that section now; he has never been seen since he left; he is a very smart, sensible negro, and will make his escape unless securely ironed. A liberal reward will be paid for one or both of them, if delivered to me at my plantation, eight miles below Brazoria, or secured so the negroes can be got. In case they are taken up, I do not want them put to work.

        Gulf prairie, July 24, 1837. LEANDER H. McNEEL.

        <b>Fifty Dollars Reward</b>
        <br/>
        IN Texas Treasury notes, will be paid for the apprehension and delivery to me of my Negro Man, TOM, who ran away from me at Harrisburg, on the night of Saturday, the 13th inst., or twenty-five dollars, and all expenses will be paid, for lodging him in any jail in this Republic, so that I can get him.
        <br/><br/>
        Said negro is about twenty-six or twenty-eight years of age, black complexion, good face, rather long nose for a negro, and remarkable for the beauty and symmetry of his athletic proportions, and for a sweet soft voice. He has good broadcloth clothes with him, and one green and one white blanket; no scars, or particular marks that I know of. I lately purchased him of Thomas C Woodlief, of Washington county, to whom he will probably say that he belongs, and for whose vicinity he will probably make.
        <br/><br/>
        He may be slightly wounded with small shot, but this is uncertain, as I have not seen him since I fired at him.
        <br/>
        A. Briscoe, Harrisburg, June 19
