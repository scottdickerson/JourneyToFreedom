        <br/>
        …we have in the South a people who are anxious to work because they want education for their children; they want land, and houses, and churches, books and papers. In a word, they want the highest and best in our civilization. Looked at, then, from the most material and selfish point of view, it has paid to awaken the Negro’s mind, and there should be no limit placed upon the development of that mind.
        <br/><br/>
        Does the American Negro take advantage of opportunities to secure education? Practically no school house has been opened for the Negro since the war that has not been filled. Often hungry and in rags, making sacrifices of which you little dream, the Negro youth has been determined to annihilate his mental darkness….
        <br/><br/>
        …the present opportunities for education are woefully inadequate for both races….for the year 1900 – 1901, $35,400,000 were spent for the education of both races in the South, of which $6,000,000 went to Negroes…
