        <b>Sarah Ford’s Narrative</b>
        <br/>
        Law me, dey was heaps of things go on in slave time what won't go on no more, 'cause de bright light has come. Yes, suh, praise de Lawd, de bright light shine an' it ain't dark no more for us black folks.
        <br/><br/>
        When freedom come, I didn't know what dat was at fust. I rec'lec's Uncle Charley Burns what drive de buggy for Marster Charles , come runnin' out in de yard an' holler 'everybody free, everybody free', an' pretty soon some sojers come an' de Capt'in reads a proclamation to all de folks, white folks an' us black folks, too. An' law me, dat's one time Marster Charles can't open his mouth, 'cause de Capt'in tell him to shut up, dat he would do de talkin'. Den de Capt'in say to slaves 'we come to let you know you is free an' you don't have to call nobody "Marster" no more'. Well, we jes' mill 'round like you sometime see cattle do, an' after de sojers leave Marster Charles say we is free as he is, but iffen anybody want to stay an' work, dey gits paid for it, all 'ceptin' my papa. He say 'Mike , you can't stay here 'cause you is a bad influence, but iffen Jane an' Sarah an' de baby want to stay, dey can.'Papa lef' de yard, but fore long comes back with a wagon an' mules what he has borrowed, an' loads us in an' we goes to East Columbia on de Brazos an' settle on down dere. Mamma an' papa an' me hire out 'cause I was a big girl an' strong, an' we has a patch our own, too, what we makes a crop on, an' dat was de fust time I ever see money. We has a cabin what papa built an' a corn crib out in de back, 'cause we raise our feed, too, an' we sure was happy 'cause de bright light had come an' day wasn't no more whippin's.
        <br/><br/>
        I stay with papa an' mamma 'til I gits married to Wes Ford , an' I shows you how de Lawd give an' He take away too. Wes an' I has a cabin by ourselves right near de folks an' I is jes' about have my fust baby. De wind start blowin' an' it get harder an' harder an' right when its de worst, de baby comes. Dat was in '75, an' whilst I was havin' my baby, de wind tear de cabin whar mamma an' papa is at to pieces an' killed 'em. Rachel was with me an' dey would been, too, but dey couldn't git to me 'count of de storm, an' dat's why I say it's de truth dat de Lawd give an' He take 'way, too.  But I can't complain, 'cause de Lawd has sure been good to me. Wes an' all 'cept four of my chillen is dead, I'se had six boys an' five girls, but de ones what is alive is po' like dere mammy is. But I praise de Lawd 'cause de bright light is turned on now, an' dey won't be no more bad times for black folks like slave times.
