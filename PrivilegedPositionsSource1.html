        <b>Testimony, March 31, 1857<br/>
        Filed by Charles F. Patton, Mathew T. C. Patton, America Ragland, Margareta Murphree and David Murphree, heirs at law of the said C. R. Patton
        </b>
        <br/>
        And by way of further amendment the said heirs say that during the entire year of 1853 the said C.R. Patton was of unsound mind and incapable of making a valid will and testament. And by way of further amendment they say that the said instrument offered for probate is not the last will of the said C. R. Patton, but that it was extorted from him by the threats, fraudulent conduct, and artful advices of a certain Negro woman slave named Rachel with whom the said C. R. Patton lived in disgraceful intimacy and who had undue influence and control over the said C. R. Patton, and who is one of the legatees named in said will, being allowed one hundred dollars per annum and in effect set free. And they further say that of the fraudulent conduct, and cunning advices of the said Negro woman Rachel, the said C. R. Patton was prejudiced against them, and that said instrument is not the last will of the said C. R. Patton, but was extorted and forced from him by the undue influence of his slave.

        <b>Testimony of Charles Grimm, overseer, 1857</b>
        <br/>
        I oversaw for him in 1847, 1848, and 1849. … I was not with him in 1850. I oversaw for him in 1851 and was with him in the early part of 1852. He was not at home much until the fall of 1851.
        <br/><br/>
        The Negro woman Rachel occupied the position of a white woman as much as any I ever knew. From the time I went there 1847 to the time he was taken away. I should say she was the mistress of the plantation. I never saw her do anything more than pour out coffee and wait on the table. She always had servants for her and never done anything her self more than pour out the coffee and wait about the house. I thought they lived more like man and wife and that she had more control over him than I ever saw a lady have over her husband or as much so. I can’t say that she treated me well. She done everything she could to annoy me. I was not a favorite of hers and she done all she could to annoy me. Mr. Patton was aware of her conduct to me. My health was not very good when I was there in 1852. I some mornings did not get out to the field as soon as I would have done if I had been in good health. The cause of my leaving was that she came over to the quarters one morning about sun up and said the Negroes were doing as they pleased and had no one to manage them and went on at a terrible rate and I don’t know what she did not say Mr. Patton was at the house but I don’t know – whether he heard her or not, he was at home & she hallowed loud enough for him to hear her.
        I was there when Mr. Adriance & Mrs. Underwood came out to examine some papers & was present when the will was found. Rachel had knowledge of the contents of that will. After Mr. Adriance & Mrs. Underwood left she came into my room and asked me if they had found a will. I told her there was a paper found which I supposed was his will. She knew what was in it as well as I did after reading it & told me all about it. Who the property was left to & who was set free & all about it. She talked about the will and observed that Master Mat did not get anything; Master Mat is a nephew of Mr. Patton. She saw the reason Mat did not get anything that he was always pounding her & beating her & that was the reason he did not get anything. …
        <br/><br/>
        Col. Patton had fallen out with his bro. St. Clair Patton & had a difficulty about the woman Rachel.  I have heard him speak of him. Mathew Patton his nephew. I heard
        him say that if Mat would do as he ought to or he would do a good part by him. …
        <br/><br/>
        I don’t think the Negro woman Rachel can write. I am satisfied & I don’t think she can read. The Negro woman Rachel of whom ? has testified is the same one mentioned in the will now before the court.
        <br/><br/>
        The difficulty between C. R. Patton & St. Clair Patton was about the woman Rachel. Mat told me that he had whipped Rachel and that his uncle had abused him for it &
        that they had liked to have had a difficulty about it.

        Testimony of Isaac T. Tinsley, neighbor
        </b>
        <br/>
        I was acquainted with C. R. Patton in the latter part of the spring or the first part of the summer of 1831. … about 1845. This Negro Rachel was in the habit of attending church and upon one occasion she took her seat with the ladies near my family. She had done so several times before, but upon this occasion took up more room than usual. I asked pastor to speak to her and let her know which seats was intended for slaves. I understood that he had spoken to her on the subject & after that Mr. Patton & I were not friendly.

        I have lived with Mr. Patton. I lived with him in the Spring of 1851 and the Summer & Fall of 1852. I never seen Mat Patton whip Rachel, though I heard he did. I heard the whipping it was when Mat Patton was overseeing there. She abused Mr. Mat Patton. I have heard her abuse him for everything she could lay her tongue to, this abuse I speak of was at the residence of C. R. Patton. She was in the habit of treating the workmen and overseers very badly. Where Mr. Patton could hear it.
        <br/><br/>
        Rachel seemed to be mistress of the place more than a servant. I did not hear Ms. C. R. Patton [Rachel] quarrel with Mat Patton but understand that he did & think that Mr. Mat Patton told me so himself.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Testimony of E. S. Jackson, neighbor</b>
        <br/>
        I knew Mr. Patton from 1842 & was at his house a good deal.
        …I couldn’t say the woman Rachel occupied the position of a servant. If she wanted warm cakes or coffee, she had servants to bring it & seemed to have charge of the house and because, she Rachel appeared to have a great deal of influence over Mr. Patton. … I have known Mr. Patton to whip house Negroes when she Rachel would tell him & have known her to whip them herself. I never knew Mr. Patton to whip Rachel or have her whipped. She had a horse she used to use & she claimed it. I never saw anyone else use it.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Testimony of George O. Jarvis, neighbor</b>
        <br/>
        I knew Col. Patton since 1840. … In 1843 and 1844 Mr Patton’s mother and her two daughters were on the place and she (Rachel) was kept a little more in her place and after that she had the entire swing of the place. The influence by Rachel over Mr. Patton was very great, and it was observable while Mr. Patton’s mother & sisters were on the place. One of the years of 1843 or 1844, there was some difficulty between C. R. Patton & his mother, that Mrs. Patton complained to Columbus Patton that Rachel would not do work as she directed and that Mr. Patton replied that she was bringing up that old matter again. Mrs. Patton remarked to C. R. Patton that when she spoke to Rachel she wheeled off and put her arm akimbo and paid no attention to her at all.
        <br/><br/>
        She (Rachel) treated the overseer and workmen pretty rough. I have heard her mutter and jaw at them where Mr. Patton could hear her. I never knew him Mr. Patton to do anything.
        <br/><br/>
        Whenever there was any new goods brought to town & the young ladies would purchase dresses, Rachel was sure to go and purchase some just like them. She wore those dresses on the plantation where the young ladies were.
        <br/><br/>
        I have seen Rachel sit down in the rooms with Mr. Patton & converse with him often. I have heard him & her have little spats frequently. And once when he threatened to whip she replied come on.

        <b>Answers of A. S. Tyler, 1857</b>
        <br/>
        My acquaintance commenced some time in his boyhood. I live in Kentucky….I am sorry to learn that he had had a great many difficulties with his relations and overseers on the account of the Negro girl Rachel which I had left with him in 1833. In answer to my letter which was written in January or February 1851, he acknowledged she had been the cause of difficulties with his own relations and overseers & that she had such an influence over him that he could not get shut of her… in the same letter he wrote to me that he wished Matthew to remain there & be under my influence, that he did not expect to live long and he wanted make Matthew “the Patton.” I know nothing further between Col. Patton & the girl Rachel except what I saw brewing when I left her there in 1833. I am the Uncle of M. T. C. Patton, no relation whatever to any of the balance of the family….

        <b>Testimony of John Adriance, estate administrator</b>
        <br/>
        I have known him C. R. Patton since the early part of December 1835. He was always looked upon as a shrewd practical man. I observed a change in his manners about the time his eyes first became diseased in the fall of 1850 or 1851.
        <br/><br/>
        I know the woman Rachel and always thought she had great influence over Mr. Patton. She has been in the habit of coming into my store, and buying more fine dresses than any lady in the community. …We kept an account with her individually. She frequently paid cash & sent in meal and meat from the plantation. This meal and meat & butter was sent in, in payment of her account. …She has paid me in cash at one time as high as twenty five or thirty dollars and had some charged to her masters account besides. She bought dry goods for herself to a larger amount than my wife bought. Judging from her bills with me her accounts were at least one hundred and fifty dollars a year. Mostly fine drapes. She dealt also in Columbia at the other stores.

        <br/>
        I don’t know what Rachel’s original capacity might have been but from her association she is certainly much more informed in her mental capacity than any other Negro woman I know of. I have heard her talking about the affairs of people in the community that would generally engross the attention of white people. So far as my knowledge extends I regard her as being shrewd for a Negro & I believe from things that have come under my own observation that she is a very cunning Negro.

        <br/>
        The Negro woman Rachel has been induced to remove to Cincinnati, Ohio. Petitioner has and will continue to pay the annual allowance provided for her. But her presence near the plantation and slaves belonging to said estate was believed to have become exceedingly injurious to the interest of said estate and perhaps dangerous. That it was deemed not only best but necessary to procure her removal and she was therefore induced to remove to Cincinnati. In relation to this matter your petitioner rather permitted it to be done, than procured it to be done, but it was done with petitioners entire approbation, and recognition of the necessity of the case.
