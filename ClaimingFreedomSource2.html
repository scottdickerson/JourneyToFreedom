        <b>Runaway Slaves in Mexico.</b>
        <br/>
        …As we turned a corner near the bank, we came suddenly upon two negroes, as they were crossing the street. One of them was startled, and looking ashamed and confounded, turned hesitatingly back and walked away from us; whereat some Mexican children laughed, and the other negro, looking at us, grinned impudently – expressing plainly enough – ‘I am not afraid of you.’ …
        <br/><br/>
        He very civilly informed me, in answer to inquiries, that he was born in Virginia, and had been brought South by a trader and sold to a gentleman who had brought him to Texas, from whom he had run away four or five years ago. .
        <br/><br/>
        He was a mechanic, and could earn a dollar very easily, by his trade, every day. He could speak Spanish fluently, and had traveled extensively in Mexico, sometimes on his own business, and sometimes as a servant or muleteer. …
        <br/><br/>
        He had joined the Catholic True Church, he said, and he was very well satisfied with the country.
        <br/><br/>
        ...The masters take care, when negroes are brought into Western Texas, that they are informed…of the dangers and difficulties to be encountered by a runaway.
        <br/><br/>
        There is a permanent reward offered by the state for their recovery, and a considerable number of men make a business of hunting them…If so taken, they are severely punished…If they escape immediate capture by dogs or men, there is then the great dry desert country to be crossed, with the danger of falling in with the savages, or of being attacked by panthers or wolves, or of being bitten or stung by the numerous reptiles that abound in it…
        <br/><br/>
        Brave negro! Say I. He faces all that is terrible to man for the chance of liberty…
