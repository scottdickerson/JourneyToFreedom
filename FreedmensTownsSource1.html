        It seems to me that the time has fully come for the Negroes to put their means together and in some way make way for the profitable employment of their sons and daughters who are now undergoing long and tedious courses of training in those colleges, academies and free graded schools of this country. To educate them, which enlarges their aspirations and makes them more ambitious, without a ghost of show for profitable employment, is suicide….
    <br/><br/>
        …The white man is pushing into everything in which a dollar can be found. The Negro can hold these positions only by underbidding him, which too often results in violence to the Negro, and in final analysis to the organization of labor unions for protection against cheap Negro labor. Thus, the Negro is shut out from all lucrative positions….it is now very difficult for a Negro to get good paying positions if a white man can do it half so well…this is the most daring and mightiest blow that has ever been made to check the Negro’s progress, for if men cannot earn money they cannot save money, nor buy property, nor school their children, etc. The Negroes are said to be worth more than six hundred millions of dollars of wealth in this country. Why not invest some of it in business enterprises that will give our children employment. Let us wake up and stop trying to cut one another’s throats, and while the South halloos cotton factories! Cotton factories! Let us halloo nearer my brother to thee, nearer to thee. This will make us patronize Negro business enterprises and stop speaking discouraging things about them. As long as the Negro eats, wears clothes, shoes, reads, farms, there will be needs upon which men may establish a profitable business, and if properly supported will give employment to our boys and girls.
