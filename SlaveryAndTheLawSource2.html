        <b>Julian Blanks’ Narrative</b>
        <br/>
        I was born in San Antonio, in 1862. My mother's name was Rachael Miller, I don't know if she was born in Tennessee or Mississippi, I heard her talk of both places. I don't know nothing about my father, because he run off when I was about
        three months old. He was three-quarter Cherokee Indian. They were lots of Indians then…

        You see, my grandmother was free born, but they stole her
        and sold her to Miss Donaldson. She was half French. She looked jes’ like a French woman. She wasn't a slave, but she and her brother were stolen and sold.
