        <br/> <br/>
        Dear Mr. Rosenwald: <br/>
        I have considered carefully the suggestion which you made regarding the method of helping the colored schools of the South, and after looking into the matter with some care, I am convinced, as I suggested to you, that it would hardly be possible to help through the medium of the state, as the states, as states, do not recognize the matter of race with reference to dealing with the public schools. The only provision made in the constitutions of the Southern states is that the schools must be separate as to race, and that the money must be divided equitably between the races. This means that the money given by the state is sent out into the various counties of the state and that the county board of education divides the money between the races as it sees fit, in most cases, the colored schools receiving a very small share.
        <br/> <br/>
        …There is no work that I do in the South that I get more satisfaction out of than going through different states and talking directly to Southern white audiences about the interest they should take in the education of the Negro. ..
        <br/> <br/>
        I have enclosed somewhat in tabulated form my ideas. I would add that I have gone over this matter thoroughly with a number of our workers, and the plan suggested has their approval. I should hope that the scheme would carry with it a plan for building school houses as well as extending the school terms. Many of the places in the South where the schools are now taught are as bad as stables, and it is impossible for the teacher to do efficient work in such places.
        <br/> <br/>
        Yours very truly,
        <br/>
        Booker T. Washington
        <br/> <br/>
        Scheme For Helping Colored Schools
        <br/>
        1.	Begin with one or more states.
        <br/>
        2.	Make the county rather than the state the unit for operation.
        <br/>
        3.	Put a man in charge of the fund who would work with and through the county officials.
        <br/>
        4.	A few of the most favorable counties to be selected to begin with.
        <br/>
        5.	Plan should embrace the building of schoolhouses, extension of school terms, and increase of teachers’ salaries.
        <br/>
        6.	Care should be taken to see that the county is not permitted to fall back on this fund and do less than it is now doing, but more in each case.
        <br/>
        7.	Some of the time, the person in charge of the fund should talk in public and in private to Southern white people in the direction of convincing them of the value of Negro education.
