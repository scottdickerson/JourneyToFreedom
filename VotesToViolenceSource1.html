        <b>Pierce Harper’s Narrative</b>
        <br/>
        After us cullud folks was considered free and turned loose, the Klu
        Klux broke out. Some cullud people started to farmin’, like I told vou, and
        gathered the old stock. If they got so they made good money, and had a good
        farm, the Klu Klux would come and murder dem. The gov'ment builded school
        houses and the Klu Klux went to work and burned em down. They'd go to the
        jails and take the cullud men out and knock their brains out and break their
        necks and throw 'em in the river.
        <br/><br/>
        There was a cullud man they taken, his name was Jim Freeman. They
        taken him and destroyed his stuff and him, cause he was making some money. Hang
        him on a tree in his front yard, right in front of his cabin.
        <br/><br/>
        There was some cullud young men went to the schools they’d opened
        by the gov'ment. Some white woman said someone had stole something of hers
        so they put them young men in jail. The Klu Klux went to the jail and took
        'em out and killed dem. That happened the second year after the War.
        <br/><br/>
        After the Klu Kluxes got so strong the cullud men got together and
        made the complaint before the law. The Gov'nor told the law to give dem the
        old guns in the com'sary, what the Southern soldiers had used, so they issued
        the cullud men old muskets and said protect themselves. They got together
        and organized the militia dey had leaders like reg'lar soldiers. They didn't
        meet ‘cept when they heered the Klu Kluxes was coming to get some cullud folks.
        Then they was ready for 'em. They'd hide in the cabins and then's when they
        found out who a lot of them ole Kluxes was, 'cause a lot of em was kilt. They
        wore long sheets and cover the hosses with sheets so you couldn’t recognize dem.
        <br/><br/>
        Men you thought was your friend was Klu Kluxes and you’d deal with 'em in
        stores in the daytime and at night they'd come out to your house and kill
        you, I never took part in none of the fights, but I heered the others talk
        ‘bout them, but not where them Klu Klux could hear 'em.

        <b>Nancy King’s Narrative</b>
        <br/>
        My brother-in-law, Sam Pitman, tells us how he put one by the Klu
        Kluxers. Him and some niggers was out one night and the Kluxers chases them on
        hosses. They run down a narrow road and tied four strands of grapevine ‘cross
        the road, 'boat breast high to a hoss. The Kluxers come gallopin’ down that
        road and when the hosses hit that grapevine, it throwed them every which way
        and broke some their arms. Sam used to laugh and tell how them Kluxers cussed
        them niggers.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>William Hamilton’s Narrative</b>
        <br/>
        I ‘members seein’ Ben Baldwin and Jeb Johnson and Dan Hester
        gittin’ whupped by de Klux. Dey wasn’t so bad after women. It am always
        after dark when dey cames to de house and catches de man and whups him for
        nothing. Dey has de power, and it am done for to show dey has de power. It
        gits so bad round here, dat de menfolks allus eats supper befo’ dark and
        takes a blanket and goes to de woods for to sleep. Alex Buford don't sleep
        in de house for one whole summer.
        <br/><br/>
        No one knowed when de Klux comin’. All a-sudden up dey gallops on
        hosses, all covered with hoods, and bust right into de house. Jus' latches
        ‘stead of locks was used  in dem days. Dey comes sev'ral times to Alex’s house
        but never catches him. I’d hear dem comin’ when dey hit de lane and I'd
        holler, De Klux am comin.’ It was my job, after dark, listenin' for dem
        Klux, den I gits under de bed.
        <br/><br/>
        Why dey comes so many times round here, am cause de second time
        dey comes, Jane Hensom am dere. Jane am lots of woman, wide as de door and
        tall, and weighs 'bout three hundred pounds. I calls, 'Here comes de Klux,'
        and makes for under de bed. There am embers in de fireplace and she fills
        a pail with dem and when de Klux busts in de door she lets dem have de embers
        in de face, and den out de back door she goes. Two of dem am burnt purty
        bad. De nex' night back dey comes and asks where Jane am. She 'longs to
        Massa John Ditto and am so big everybody knows her, but de niggers won't
        tell on her. She leaves de county fin'ly, but dey comes lookin' for her
        every night for two months.
