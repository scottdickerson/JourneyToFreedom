        ‘spect de devil done make him overseer down below long time ago. Dat de bad part of Massa Charles, ‘cause he lets Uncle Jake whip de slaves so much dat some like my papa what had spirit was all de time runnin’ ‘way. And even does your stomach be full, and does you have plenty clothes, dat bullwhip on your bare hide make you forgit de good part, and dat’s de truth.
        <br/><br/>
        Uncle Big Jake sho’ work de slaves from early mornin’ till night. When you is in de field you better not lag none. …'Iffen a nigger run away and dey cotch him, or does he come back ‘cause he hongry, I seed Uncle Jake stretch him out on de ground and tie he hands and feet to posts so he can’t move none. Den he git de piece of iron what he call de ‘slut’ and what is like a block of wood with little holes in it, and fill de holes up with tallow and put dat iron in de fire till de grease sizzlin’ hot and hold it over de pore nigger’s back and let dat hot grease drap on he hide. Den he take de bullwhip and whip up and down, and after all dat throw de pore nigger in de stockhouse and chain him up a couple days with nothin’ to eat. My papa carry de grease scars on he back till he die. …

De black folks all hated him so dey wouldn’t have no truck with him and he ask my papa could he stay. Papa didn’t like him none, ‘cause he done treat papa so bad, but de old devil jus’ beg so hard papa takes him out to de corn crib and fix a place for him and stay most a month till he taken sick and died.
